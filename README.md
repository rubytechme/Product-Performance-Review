## Analysis: 

### Total Sales/YoY growth

Total sales for the company’s products in 2024 amounted to $475.6K. When compared year-over-year, this reflects a 30% increase over 2023, indicating clear and positive growth momentum.

### Total Profit/YoY growth

In 2024, total profit reached $411.6K, representing a 34% increase compared to the previous year. While this growth is commendable, it also indicates that the company incurred approximately $64K in costs.

With a profit margin of 86.56%, the company is demonstrating exceptionally strong profitability, suggesting efficient operations and potentially signaling its position as a key player in the market.


### Total Cost/YoY growth

A deeper look into the cost structure reveals that the total cost incurred in 2024 was $64K, reflecting an 11% increase compared to the previous year. While this rise in cost may appear concerning at first glance, it is more accurately viewed as a sign of business growth—as it directly supports a higher revenue and stronger profit outcome.

The increase in cost is proportional to the company’s expanding operations and improved financial performance, suggesting that the business is scaling efficiently while maintaining healthy margins.


### Total Quantity/YoY growth

In 2024, total quantity sold reached 899 units, marking an increase of 245 units compared to 2023. This growth can be largely attributed to increased sales activity and improved inventory availability throughout the year.

However, a deeper analysis reveals that total revenue exceeded expectations based on historical pricing. Using the 2023 average unit price of $505, the projected revenue for 2024—given a quantity of 899—would have been approximately $454K. Yet, actual revenue stood at $475.6K, indicating that either the average unit price increased in 2024 or higher-value items contributed to the sales mix.

This outperformance suggests positive momentum in pricing strategy or product offerings and warrants further exploration into product-level pricing trends and customer purchase behavior.


## Key Insights: 

### Monthly revenue Trend

A closer examination of monthly revenue reveals that in 2024, the company recorded its highest revenue in April, July, and September. In contrast, the peak months for 2023 were March and August—months that underperformed in 2024.

Interestingly, a consistent pattern emerges in 2024: each high-performing month was preceded by a month with strong revenue momentum. For example, revenue in March, June, and August showed solid performance, directly leading into the peaks observed in April, July, and September, respectively.

This pattern may suggest a lagging sales effect, where marketing campaigns, promotions, or customer engagement activities in one month translate into stronger revenue in the next. Understanding this trend can be valuable for planning demand generation efforts, inventory stocking, and resource allocation more effectively.

### Yearly Product comparison

In 2023, the top-performing products were Keyboards and Headphones, while in 2024, the leading products shifted to Monitors and Mice. The significant difference in product performance—particularly the shift toward higher-value items like Monitors—is likely a major contributor to the increased profit in 2024.

Overall, there does not appear to be a consistent pattern in product preferences across the two years. This variability suggests that customer demand may be influenced by external factors such as promotions, seasonal needs, or shifts in technology trends, rather than a stable purchase behavior.


### Regional Sales Distribution

The South region consistently emerged as the top-performing state for product sales and revenue, maintaining the highest sales figures in both 2023 and 2024. Its strong and stable performance reinforces its role as the company’s leading market.

Meanwhile, the West region maintained steady performance, recording similar sales levels in 2024 as it did in 2023.

Notably, the East region demonstrated the most significant improvement, with a substantial increase in sales in 2024 compared to 2023. This marked growth highlights the East as a rising market and presents a strategic opportunity for further investment and expansion.

## Conclusion and Recommendations:

### Conclusion

The company’s performance in 2024 reflects significant progress, marked by a 30% increase in total sales revenue and a 34% rise in profit compared to 2023. Profit margins remain exceptionally strong at 86.56%, indicating high operational efficiency despite a moderate 11% increase in costs—a signal of sustainable growth rather than inefficiency.

Sales quantity also improved, with 899 units sold in 2024, up from 654 in 2023. Interestingly, actual revenue outperformed projections based on historical pricing, suggesting a possible increase in average unit price or a shift toward higher-value product sales, such as Monitors and Mice.

Monthly revenue patterns revealed that April, July, and September were the best-performing months in 2024, with strong revenue often preceded by solid performance in the prior month, suggesting a lagging effect likely influenced by marketing or buyer behavior. Additionally, product preferences varied year to year, indicating demand is likely seasonal or campaign-driven rather than consistent.

Regionally, the South remained the strongest market, while the East showed the most notable year-over-year improvement, presenting clear potential for strategic growth.

### Key Recommendations
1. Capitalize on High-Margin Product Shifts
- Leverage the growing demand for higher-value products like Monitors and Mice.
- Optimize inventory and promotion strategies around these categories to maintain upward momentum.

2. Refine Monthly Sales Strategy
- Utilize the insight that strong months often follow high-performing prior months.
- Front-load campaigns, discounts, or product launches in months like March, June, and August to drive stronger revenue in April, July, and September.

3. Explore Regional Growth Opportunities
- Maintain strong support and presence in the South region while expanding marketing, partnerships, and logistics in the East, where sales are growing rapidly.

4. Deepen Pricing & Product Analytics
- Conduct a detailed analysis to confirm if the average unit price increased or if product mix shifts explain the revenue surplus in 2024.
- Use this insight to fine-tune pricing strategy and align future product offerings with high-margin opportunities.

5. Anticipate Demand Shifts
- Since product preference is not consistent year to year, implement quarterly demand forecasting models based on promotions, customer behavior, and seasonality.
- Remain agile with product sourcing and stock allocation based on upcoming trends.
